###April Wright
I'm a grad student in David Hillis' [lab](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu). I'm broadly interested in phylogenetic estimation, particularly with an eye towards to fossil record. You can keep up with me on my [website](wrightaprilm.github.io).
