##Contributing

OK, here's how to contribute to the repository.

Initial set up:

Install [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican). You can use "pip install pelican markdown" in Terminal.
Download [Pelican Themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes). You can use "git clone --recursive https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes ~/pelican-themes" in Terminal.

Clone the repository to your machine. In the pelicanconf.py, there are some paths to themes that are 'April specific'. Edit these to reflect your paths.

Once installed:

1) First, git pull to get any updates to the repo. 
2) Then, write some content in the 'content' folder that is in the repository. The syntax for content is [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 

3) Change directories in your terminal into the repository.  

4) Type 'make github' 

5) That should be it, can someone try this for me? If you have read the directions, please edit the content/pages/Contributors.md with a sentence about yourself.
